Memsic2125_Arduino
==================

### Description
In this example we’re going to deal with the Memsic 2125 Dual-axis Accelerometer from Parallax and how to integrate it into an Arduino.

The Memsic 2125 is a low cost, dual-axis thermal accelerometer capable of measuring tilt, acceleration, rotation, and vibration with a range of ±3 g. For integration into existing applications, the Memsic 2125 is electrically compatible with other popular accelerometers.

Memsic provides the 2125 in a surface-mount format. Parallax mounts the circuit on a through-hole providing all I/O connections so it can easily be inserted on a breadboard or through-hole prototype area.
